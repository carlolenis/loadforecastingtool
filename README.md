Supply-demand integrated model to:
(1) forecast the demand of non-electrified communities
(2) identify the optimal technology mix
(3) run a supply-demand balancing simulation

Notes:
- Targeted users are rural non-electrified communities, but the model works for any sample provided.
- Only solar, wind, and hydro technologies are considered in the model.
- Timesteps are set to an hourly analysis.
- The format provided in the Excel file must be followed to run the model (example for 4 rural villages in Guatemala).
- Provided weather data can be monthly averages (as provided in the example) or hourly historical data.
